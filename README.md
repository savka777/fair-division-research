# Fair Division Implementation/Research

| Project | Directory | Algorithms Implemented & Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brute Force Fair Division Solver** | [`LINK`](Basic%20Fair%20Division) | This project implements a brute-force algorithm to find all envy-free and proportional allocations for a two-agent fair division problem. |
| **Envy Graph & EF1 Solver** | [`LINK`](Envy%20Free%20Graph) | This project implements a directed Envy Graph to represent envy relationships between agents in a fair division problem. It includes an algorithm to find allocations that satisfy the Envy-Free-up-to-one-item (EF1) fairness criteria by building the graph, identifying envy cycles, and eliminating them via bundle rotation. |
